MSTest is a Unit Testing Framework

Unit Testing - Developer

when we will use unit Testing  no need to use PSVM 
we have use Annotations 

[TestMethod] along with [TestClass]

Can we override main method 

[TestInitalization] - It will run before every [TestMethod] annotation
[TestCleanUp]- it will run after every [TestMethod] Annotation


[AssemblyInitalize] - It will execute  once Before any of the [testMethod]
[AssemblyCleanup] - It will execute once  after any of the [TestMethod]

[AssemblyInitalize]
[TestMethod]-test1
[TestMethod]- test2
[TM]- Test3
[TM]- Test4
[AssemblyCLeanup]

That will work only static method


in selenium we have multiple locator and every thing is called as webelement 

id 
name

xapth
css
linktext
classname

in selenium we have two methods

sendkeys--  writing somethimg inside into the text box
click() - click on any webelement /button/link as well

Xpath -- locators

Purple color - Tag Name
Red Color - -Attribute
Blue Color - Value
Black - Text value

1- //tagname[@attribute='value']

//input[@title='Search']

2-  //tagname[text()='textvalue']

//a[text()='Gmail']

//a[text()='Customer Service']

3- (//a[text()='Customer Service'])[1] -- Location Wise xpath

//a[text()='Today's Deals']

with the help of contains in xpath

//tagname[contains(text(),'search value')]

//a[contains(text(),'Deals')]

*/
(//a[@data-ip-position='offers-hover-menu'])[1]
